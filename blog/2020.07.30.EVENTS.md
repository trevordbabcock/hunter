## Event queue
In my previous post I described my approach to tracking and handling events in the game. I'm currently using an event queue, and any time I need an event to happen in the future, I enqueue that event along with the time at which it should occur.

It occurred to me today that technically I'm not enqueueing most of these events, but rather I'm inserting them into a particular location in the list so that the list remains sorted ascending by time. With that being the case, I'm not sure how well this will scale, since I don't know what data structure underlies Python's list (presumably a linked list), and I don't think binary searches work well on linked lists (need to research this more). Insertions and deletes are fast with a linked list, but finding where you need to insert or delete will average to log(n).

I wonder if it's possible to have my events represented as both an array and a hash at the same time. For example, both data structures could just maintain references/pointers to the actual objects. I'm sure there's tons of information out there about this type of thing. I'll have to do some research.

However, at this point in time, I think it's premature to worry about it too much. So I'm jotting down my thoughts there, and I'll return to this when the need arises.

Welp, see you later.
