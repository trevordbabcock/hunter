## Goals and Playability

I've decided it's a good idea to put some effort in to making the game more "playable". While you don't directly control any entities in the game, the game should still be at least somewhat enjoyable to observe. The original idea, after all, was to make a simulation that presents a fascinating world and gives the player the tools to observe the interesting behaviors and interactions within it.

Currently, the most you can do is observe the entities moving around, and mouse over certain tiles to see a tiny amount of additional information about what's on that tile. But there is no extra information provided about entities other than the hunter. Furthermore, it can be difficult at times to even find entities of a certain type.

For all these reasons, I'm planning to make a number of UI changes to make the simulation more observable. For example, I'll be adding the ability to select individual entities so that the player can get more info about them, including an action log for each entity. I'll also be adding the ability to hide and show entities by type, so if you don't want to see rabbits, you can simply toggle to hide them.

There are a few quality-of-life changes I'll be making as well:
- ability to pause the game
- 'escape' menu with option to show game controls
- ability to save and load the game

I think these changes will go a long way toward making it feel a lot more like a game.

Welp, see you later.
