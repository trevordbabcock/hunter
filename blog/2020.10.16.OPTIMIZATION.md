## OPTIMIZATION
Holy fucking shit I just optimized the shit out of the game. I'm so excited that I just want to write a quick blog post about it.

The first task I tackled for POC v0.8 was to "improve render performance". The game's performance has been shit-tier pretty much since the beginning. I never gave it too much thought because it's just ascii characters moving around in a console window; terrible performance doesn't really impact the player experience all that much. Of course, I knew that I'd have to optimize it eventually, but it was always a "later problem". And I guess "later" is "now", because I finally got fed up with it being so bad.

I knew that the render performance in particular was the problem because, while trying to fix another issue, I had fiddled with the core game loop and in so doing discovered that when I turned rendering off, the game ran SUPER fast, even when it was still simulating tons of rabbits and things underneath the surface. Which means my simulation code was not the bottleneck; the render code was.

I began working on this two or three days ago, and I started by hooking up a very simple Python profiler, cProfile. I set it up to run once on the hundredth iteration of the game loop running. And when it runs, it just dumps a huge text blob for you to sift through, like this:

This isn't all of the output, but some serious problems jump out immediately:
* A total of 41,253 functions are being called on every single frame.
* Some function is getting called 4000 times, along with everything inside it.
* This one frame took 106 milliseconds to compute (about 10 frames per second).

With performance results this catastrophically bad, the good news is that there is likely some VERY low-hanging fruit that, once fixed, will result in huge performance gains. With that said, I must be honest admit that I was a bit intimidated going into this task. I haven't had to use profilers very often, so it was somewhat new territory. But more than that, how libtcod renders is very much an unknown to me. I wasn't sure that I understood (or could understand) the library well enough to be able to improve the render speed. For example, a google search led me to the idea that I could draw all the tiles off-screen in a separate console, then "blit" them into the root console. Supposedly this would result in fewer draw operations and save me some computations, but I had no idea if that would really help and how much. Furthermore, I know that Python is slow, so I was somewhat afraid that I may have already hit the limit of what I could hope to accomplish with such a simple "engine", if you can call it that. And so I was beginning to wonder if it would be necessary to switch to a more legit and performant engine. Dwelling on all these things was definitely weighing on me a bit, and I felt I was losing a bit of steam on the project as a whole.

Well, on to the solution. Four thousand is an awfully round number, so it didn't take me long to figure out where that number was coming from: my map size is 80x50. So clearly I'm drawing every single tile in the whole map on every single iteration of the game loop, when in actuality I probably only needed to redraw like 20 or so on average (wild guess). So I figured I could set up a system to keep track of which tiles changed in a meaningful way during a given iteration, and then redraw only those.

This turned out to be quite simple to set up. I spent the most time looking up how to use numpy properly. I wanted to use this opportunity to dig into numpy a bit, because I knew I'd need to understand this tool well if I wanted to fend off performance problems in an ongoing basis. I used numpy to generate an 80x50 matrix of 'False' values. This would be used to track which tiles should be redrawn. Then I wrote some code to modify this matrix any time something significant happened to a tile. For example, any time an entity moved, I would mark the previous tile and the destination tile as needing to be redrawn. In this way, the vast majority of tiles can be left alone each iteration. Amazing.

I also added redraw logic around mouse hovers, fog reveals, fog toggling, UI toggling, and time-of-day changes. And now that all of those are in place, the game back to working exactly like it used to, except at about 60 frames per second instead of 3 to 10 frames per second!

And here's the profiler output from after I made these changes:

From 41k function calls down to less than 1k function calls. Incredible. And there was great rejoicing.

Welp, see you later.
