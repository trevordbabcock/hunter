## Of Swamps and Things

Wanted to make a quick note that I packed WAY too much stuff into v1.1, and it has turned out to be quite a quagmire. Version 1.1 contains the following:
- Escape menu
- Buttons (clickable!!)
- Pausing the game
- Entity selection (with mouse!!!)
- Stats panel for selected entity
- Entity overview panel
- Ability to show/hide entities by type
- Saving and loading the game
- Major change to how entity actions work
- Some bug fixes

What in god's name was I thinking...

Well, the UI stuff has turned out to be a ton of work (but has also turned out super cool so far). I'm over halfway done with all of the UI tasks, so I figured I would move out the non-UI tasks into the next version. For now I'll hold off on the saving/loading, entity action refactor, and bug fixes, saving those for v1.2.

By moving these out, I can start to see the end of the tunnel. :) Just a bit further now.

Welp, see you later.
