## Proof of Concept v0.6
POC v0.6 is complete as of today. This was a big one, where I added a camp for the hunter, the ability for the hunter to sleep at the camp to recover energy, and the ability for the hunter to shoot their bow, kill rabbits, and eat them (and several smaller changes as well). Originally, I had only intended to add the hunter's ability to shoot the bow in this version (conceivably at a fake target, tree, or something like that), but I decided on-the-fly to pull in a task from v0.7, and get the bow shooting and rabbit hunting working all at once. 

All of these systems are in place, though I cut corners on certain aspects of them, meaning they still need a good deal of tweaking. POC v0.7 is almost completely focused on tweaking things that are already there, so I'm in a great position heading into that version.

Here's an image of the first rabbit ever killed by a hunter (the little 'x'). For this kill, I had mistakenly left out some logic, resulting in the hunter shooting the dead rabbit over and over, forever. Rough times for the rabbit:

## Hunter Info
I made a couple minor changes to the hunter to add just a bit more interest. The hunter now gets a random name selected from a list of curated old-timey sounding names. I feel that as the game develops and the hunter's plight becomes more interesting, it will be cool to have a name for the hunter you're observing. That way if the hunter is really crushing it, you may think to yourself "Wow, Alodie is such a hardass" or something like that. :)

I also added the first stats being tracked for the hunter: number of days surived (real-time and game-time). This is another important aspect to adding interesting to the hunter's plight. I know that there will soon come a day where I think to myself "Oh shit, Kingsley has survived for 20 in-game days!"

## Camp
The hunter now has a place to call home! The hunter camp currently spawns statically at a certain point on the map. When I implemented fog of war, I gave the hunter a memory so they could keep track of what they'd explored so far. In order for the hunter to be able to return to their camp at appropriate times, I added the location of the camp to their memory as well. Now when the hunter is running low on energy, they will return to the camp and sleep in the bedroll.

Besides the bedroll, the camp has a couple other components like a firepit and a wood pile. These are not currently in use, but I spent quite a bit of time thinking about how they might work. For the firepit, I'd like to have different levels of fire, such as smoldering, blazing, etc., where different levels confer different benefits. And of course the fire would burn down slowly over time, and would need to have more fuel added. I think that, at night, a fire should provide comfort bonuses to sleep (faster energy recovery), as well as defensive bonuses, helping to ward off certain kinds of predators.

I even started to think about how I would model fuel for the fire e.g. would the hunter have to search for different types of fuel like kindling, logs, etc. I added the wood pile component to the camp in order to have somewhere to store fuel, but after dwelling on the idea for a while, I decided that it was not urgent to implement fires. Which means that, as of right now, when the hunter hunts and kills a rabbit, they eat the rabbit raw. Yum.

## Hunting and AI
The hunter hunts rabbits in a reasonable, but not completely ideal, way. When the hunter is hungry, they look around for food (either berry bushes or rabbits). If they spot a rabbit, they take a shot at the rabbit with their bow. If the rabbit is hit, the hunter does not immediately go and collect the carcass, but insteads checks if they are hungry again. This causes them to, again, look around for berry bushes and rabbits. If they spot another living rabbit, they will likely shoot it as well. The cycle will repeat again, and if there are no living rabbits, the hunter will likely go and fetch the carcass of the nearest dead rabbit and immediately eat it (yuck).

While from a programming perspective this kind of makes sense (and was certainly easier to write), but from a behavioral perspective, this probably isn't how a hunter would really do things. It's even possible for the fetching of the first carcass to put the hunter out of visual range of the second carcass, resulting in the hunter completely ignoring the fact that they killed a second rabbit! That, especially, makes little sense.

Of course, all that completely ignores the fact that the hunter should really be storing the rabbits in their bag and, eventually, returning to camp to cook them. There is a lot of nuance to this kind of behavior e.g. how many rabbits to kill, how many berries to pick, when to eat berries immediately and when to store them in camp for later, when to return to camp, etc.

As mentioned before, the hunter is also able to sleep in camp to recover energy. However, the decision-making process around when to eat versus when to sleep is extremely rudimentary. As the code is written now, it's quite possible for the hunter to sleep themselves to death. There is yet more thought that needs to be put into how the hunter should prioritize satisfying different needs.

I'd also like to quickly note that currently the health/hunger/energy system needs to be revised a bit. If the hunter's hunger ever hits 0, they immediatley die. If the hunter's energy hits 0, nothing happens at all. What I'd like to happen, instead, is have the hunter's health start to take slow (but increasing) damage when either hunger is 0 or energy is 0, and take much quicker damage if both are 0. This way, the hunter will only ever die if their health hits 0. This gives the hunter more leeway when it comes to starvation and sleep deprivation, rather than the rather comically-severe system I have currently. This also provides opportunity to add deleterious effects to the hunter when very hungry or tired, making for (hopefully) more interesting behavior. 

I am tempted to add some of these revisions into one of the next two POC versions. We'll see.

## Game Balance
The game is pretty wildly unbalanced right now. Sleeping recovers energy super quickly, food is generally too easy to come by, arrows are infinite, hunger and energy reduction probably need tweeking, and surely a number of other things need to be addressed. This is fine, since my goal right now is simply to get various game systems in place. I just added a task to v0.8 to take a pass at balancing the game so it's a bit more reasonable.

As I mentioned in a previous post, I'm feeling tempted to push v1.0 out a bit farther. Perhaps in the next week I'll come up with a revised v1.0 and create tasks for it.

Welp, see you later.
