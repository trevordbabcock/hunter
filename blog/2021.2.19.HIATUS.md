## Back from the Dead
Due to some minor health problems, I decided to take almost a 4-month a break from working on this project. However, I now feel that I am in a good place to resume working on Hunter again.

When I left things off at the end of October, I had just added precedural of the map, balanced the game, and fixed some other issues. I had decided at that time to extend v0 to include v0.9, in which I would add wolves. I recall that, as I was starting work on v0.9, I quickly got bogged down with deciding how robust to make wolf behavior.

With that being the case, I have decided to make wolves extremely simple. Doing so will help me keep this POC version simple, and allow me to regain some momentum on this project.

Welp, see you later.
